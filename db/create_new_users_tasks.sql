This doesn''t need to be your final guest list, just a starting point. Don''t stress. Spend an evening or two listing out friends and family that you''d consider inviting and then spend a night narrowing it down, if needed. You''ll also want to decide if you''ll be inviting kids to the wedding. Often kids do count as headcount and there''s a reduced price for a kids meal. Depending on the number of kids in your friends and family, inviting kids can sometimes add quite a bit to the headcount.

Once you''re married, it will come up more than you might think, so no time like the present to get comfortable talking about it. One thing to keep in mind is that you don''t have to have a firm budget. You can have a general idea of how much you are willing to spend total on specific items. Identify the high end of your budget for the pricer items and then piece it together as you go. You also may want to ask your parents and future in-laws if they''re planning to contribute. You know your situation and relationship with your parents best, but if possible we recommend being as direct as possible. You don''t have to make too big a deal of it. It can be as simple as saying: We don''t expect you to contribute to our wedding but as we''re putting together our budget, we''re wondering if you had plans to contribute.', '', 'https://pin.it/4mJ32E3', '', '', '', '', '' false),

You don''t have to be overly specific. It can be a cloudy vision, but get an idea of what you''re both thinking. For example, if you want a black tie wedding and your fiance wants a picnic those are pretty extreme opposites, so you want to spend some time discussing and coming to agreement. We recommend using Pinterest to do some initial research on what you like and don''t like. If you''re up for it, create an inspiration board.

Pro tip: As you get close to finalizing a venue and have narrowed it down to a date (or two) ask your VIP guests (people who you would be heartbroken if they missed the wedding) if they''re available on that date. Only ask them if you''re willing to move the date if they say no, otherwise no point in asking! Once you do sign the contract for the venue and the date is set in stone, let the same group of VIP know. Another thing to keep in mind is some venues include in service and price an onsite coordinator. This can be an incredibly beneficial perk and can save you the cost of hiring a day of wedding coordinator. Negotiating Tip: if you''re having your reception at the hotel where most guests will stay, ask for them to waive the fee for distributing welcome bags to your guests and build this into the contract.', '', 'https://pin.it/3AkO5rf', 'Picking your reception venue', '', 'Venues are typically most expensive on Saturdays. If you''re open to a Friday or Sunday wedding, ask for those rates upfront. If the venue also happens to be a hotel, ask for a rate reduction on the reception space if you plan to have your wedding block set up at the hotel for out of town guests. Asking never hurts!
